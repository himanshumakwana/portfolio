              Hey there! I'm Emma, a creative designer based in San Francisco. With over 5 years 
              of experience, I've had the joy of working with amazing brands and startups to 
              create designs that truly resonate.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-lg leading-relaxed">
              My journey in design started with a simple love for colors and typography, and has 
              evolved into a passion for creating holistic brand experiences. When I'm not designing, 
              you'll find me exploring art galleries, trying new coffee shops, or sketching in my journal.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-lg leading-relaxed">
              I believe design has the power to inspire, connect, and create meaningful change. 
              Let's create something beautiful together!
            </p>
